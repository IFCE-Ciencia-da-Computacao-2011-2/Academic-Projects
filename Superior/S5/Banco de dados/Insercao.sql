It supports creating no less than 43 reverberation effects, but its design permits this to be extended even further by the user, without doing any actual programming. Please take a look at TAP Reverb Editor, a separate JACK application for more information about this.

The design is based on the comb/allpass filter model. Comb filters create early reflections and allpass filters add to this by creating a dense reverberation effect. The output of the set of comb and allpass filters (also called the reverberator chamber) is processed further by sending it through a bandpass filter. The resulting band-limited reverberation is very similar to the natural reverberation that occurs in acoustic rooms. To achieve an even more natural-sounding effect, all comb filters have high-frequency compensation in their feedback loop. This is to model that the reflection ratio of acoustic surfaces is the function of frequency: higher frequencies are attenuated more, and thus decay time of higher frequency components is significantly shorter.

To enhance the reverberation sound even further, a special option called Enhanced Stereo is provided. When turned on (which is the default), it results in an added spatial spread of the reverb sound. This feature is most noticeable when applying the plugin to mono tracks: the sound of these tracks will "open up" in space.

You want to squeeze high transient spikes down into the bulk of the audio. You want a limiter with transparent sound, but without distortion. This is for you, then. The unique design of this innocent looking plugin results in the ability to achieve signal level limiting without audible artifacts.

Most limiters operate on the same basis as compressors: they monitor the signal level, and when it gets above a threshold level they reduce the gain on a momentary basis, resulting in an unpleasant "pumping" effect. Or even worse, they chop the signal at the top. This plugin actually scales each half-cycle individually down to a smaller level so the peak is placed exactly at the limit level. This operation (from zero-cross to zero-cross) results in an instantaneous blending of peaks and transient spikes down into the bulk of the audio.

Noise shaping makes the background hiss of dither sound quieter, but adds more high-frequency noise than ''ordinary'' dither. This high frequency noise can be a problem if a recording is later processed in any way (including gain changes) especially if noise shaping is applied a second time.

If you are producing an absolutely final master at 16 bits or less, use noise shaped dither. In all other situations use a non-noise-shaped dither such as high-pass-triangular. When mastering for MP3 or other compressed formats be aware that noise shaping may take some of the encoder''s ''attention'' away from the real signal at high frequencies.

No gain changes should be applied after this plug-in. Make sure any master output fader is set to 0.0 dB in the host application.

Very technical note This plug-in follows Steinberg''s convention that a signal level of 1.0 corresponds to a 16-bit output of 32768. If your host application does not allow this exact gain setting the effectiveness of dither may be reduced (check for harmonic distortion of a 1 kHz sine wave using a spectrum analyser).', 'http://moddevices.com/plugins/mda/Dither', 11, 4),

"Flanging /ˈflændʒɪŋ/ is an audio effect produced by mixing two identical signals together, one signal delayed by a small and gradually changing period, usually smaller than 20 milliseconds. This produces a swept comb filter effect: peaks and notches are produced in the resulting frequency spectrum, related to each other in a linear harmonic series. Varying the time delay causes these to sweep up and down the frequency spectrum. A flanger is an effects unit that creates this effect.

Part of the output signal is usually fed back to the input (a "re-circulating delay line"), producing a resonance effect which further enhances the intensity of the peaks and troughs. The phase of the fed-back signal is sometimes inverted, producing another variation on the flanging sound." Wikipedia

When the player stops the signal will fall below this threshold and the signal is reduced in gain thus reducing the noise or spill."

"Compression (or more technically Dynamic range compression) is a subtle effect primarily for electric guitar where the highest and lowest points of the sound wave are "limited". This boosts the volume of softer picked notes, while capping the louder ones, giving a more even level of volume.

This plugin is the combination of guitarix''s head, tonestack and cabinet, which, in that order, composes the signal path. In the tube-amp part, "PreGain" corresponds to the gain used at the amp input, "Drive" controls the power amp gain, "Distortion" is a blend between clean and distorted sound (lower boundary is all clean, upper boundary all distorted) and "MasterGain" controls the output gain. Mainly, the responsible for the signal distortion are "PreGain" and "Drive" parameters. Besides that, there is a list of possible valve combinations so you can vary your distortion.

At the Tonestack part, we find a basic equalization set ("Bass", "Middle", "Treble" and "Presence") and a list of tone-responses from a few well-known amps, you can check this list in the link at the end of this description (there might be some version differences).

Finally, at the Cabinet path, we have "Cabinet", which corresponds to another output gain, it doesn''t distort the signal so it can be used as a Master output and there''s another list, containing a virtual sound of the cabinet of speakers selected (more details in the link below).

Bass and treble portions of the signal are isolated using two 24 dB/octave Linkwitz-Riley crossover networks[lr76] to ensure a flat frequency response at zero effect intensity (controlled through the .gain settings). After compression, a polynomial waveshaper synthesises the first three overtones of the bass register. This enhances the perception of the fundamental frequency, being the difference tone of these harmonics. Treble band processing applies analog-style saturation with only simplistic antialiasing. Synthesised harmonic content is shaped through bandpass and highpass filters and mixed back into the crossover sum signal.

To turn saturation into a musically useful effect it is usually combined with some sort of filtering and dynamics modulation.

The mode control chooses from a selection of clipping functions of varying character. Even-order harmonics can be added with the bias setting. Towards the maximum, sound will start to get scratchy and eventually starve away.

The plugin is 8x oversampled with 64-tap polyphase filters, effectively suppressing aliasing noise for most musical applications. Changes to the bias control induce short-lived energy at DC in the output. In order to reduce the computational load incurred when evaluating transcendental functions at eight times the nominal sample rate, these are approximated roughly, using Chebyshev polynomials whose coefficients depend on the amplitude''s floating point representation exponent.

When the signal''s instantaneous amplitude exceeds the opening threshold, the gate is opened. The time it takes until the gate is fully open can be set with the attack control. As soon as the signal''s RMS power level drops below the closing threshold, the gate closes. This takes a fixed time of 20 ms; closed gate attenuation is 60 dB.

To cope with powerline hum as often present in signals from electric guitars, a notch filter can be activated by setting the mains frequency control to a non-zero value.  The filter will prevent this frequency from contributing to the signal power measurement. This allows a low closing threshold setting without mains hum keeping the gate open unduly.  The default mains setting is 50 Hz.

The x, y and z controls set the amplitude of the respective variables of the attractor state in the output audio signal.

The attractor state variables are scaled and translated to stay mostly within the [-1,1] range and not contain a DC offset. Nevertheless, due to the unpredictable nature of the systems, peak limits cannot be guaranteed.  In addition, some energy near DC may be produced; therefore a configurable high-pass filter is part of the circuit.
